- make bots avoid other snakes
- add a leaderboard to view top 10 players and their score (and support bots on there)
- make a complex player movement system
- mini map system for players to see where other snacks are
- as a player grows their radius, the camera should zoom out to keep them in view (and zoom in when they shrink)
- Get/Create real game assets
- Add game over screen
- Make the game menu do something useful and customize it
- Add UI to customize snake and username before games.
- Allow custom single-player gameplay. Players can create custom games like how many bots, the difficulty, and the snake type
- refactor game after the prototype is done.
    I want to make the code a lot more 'feature flag' friendly and modular. Right now, everything is in one file, and it's hard to see small parts of the code.
- Add snake builder UI system
- Add multiplayer lobby
- Add mod system (allow loading custom snake assets like skins)
- snake team system (team mode where players can join together to kill snakes without killing each other)

Ideas: 

1. User Auth & Community

We can use a web portal for user accounts
after auth a user is given a token they cant submit 
to the desktop client to authenticate. Only one user 
can use a token at a time. When a token is submitted 
we collect info on the user device. The user can reset
a token to stop it from being used.

Without a token the user will not be able to join multiplayer.
