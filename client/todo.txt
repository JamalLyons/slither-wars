- make a complex player movement system
- mini map system for players to see where other snacks are
- Get/Create real game assets
- snake body when boosting vs normal is 2 different lengths which does not look good. When a snake is boosting its whole body should move faster
right now the head moves faster than the body has to catch up to it. which looks weird.
- improve snake movement system. Right now it's not very smooth and the segments take forever to catch up to the head. It should mimic the original slither.io game movement system.
- Add game over screen
- Make the game menu do something useful and customize it
- Add UI to customize snake and username before games.
- Allow custom single-player gameplay. Players can create custom games like how many bots, the difficulty, and the snake type
- Add snake builder UI system
- Add multiplayer lobby
- Add mod system (allow loading custom snake assets like skins)
- snake team system (team mode where players can join together to kill snakes without killing each other)

Ideas: 

1. User Auth & Community

We can use a web portal for user accounts
after auth a user is given a token they cant submit 
to the desktop client to authenticate. Only one user 
can use a token at a time. When a token is submitted 
we collect info on the user device. The user can reset
a token to stop it from being used.

Without a token the user will not be able to join multiplayer.
